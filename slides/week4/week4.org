* What are we doing today
- IMU
- Review what makes up a node
- Write a node to find an object
  - PCL
* IMU
- Inertial measurement unit
- Detects linear acceleration using accelerometers
- Detects rotational rate using gyroscopes
- Can include magnetometer for headings
- Super useful for position estimates
- Suffers from accumulated error
** RPY
- Roll, Pitch, Yaw

* Review
** What are the three files every node needs?
*** What are the three files every node needs?
- CMakeLists.txt
- package.xml
- a source file
** What is in a CMakeLists.txt file?
*** What is in a CMakeLists.txt file?
- How to build the node
  - Defines the structure of the package for the compile
  - Linking the executable ROS nodes to the appropriate libraries (OpenCV, PCL, etc..)
** What is in the package.xml file?
*** What is in the package.xml file?
- What are the dependencies of a node
- maintainer information, author, etc
** What is required for a subscriber?
*** What is required for a subscriber?
- Callback function
- Topic name
- Queue size
** What is required for a publisher?
*** What is required for a publisher?
- Topic name
- Queue size
** What things must be done in every node?
*** What things must be done in every node?
- include ros header
- ros::init
- Create NodeHandle
- ros spin
** How do I get what nodes are currently running?
*** How do I get what nodes are currently running?
- rosnode list
** How do I get information about a running node?
*** How do I get information about a running node?
- rosnode info [NAME]
** How do I get a list of the topic currently publishing?
*** How do I get a list of the topic currently publishing?
- rostopic list
** How do I get how often a topic is publishing?
*** How do I get how often a topic is publishing?
- rostopic hz [NAME]
** How do I get what is being published on a topic?
*** How do I get what is being published on a topic?
- rostopic echo [NAME]

* Output
- Must have output set to screen to print out to the terminal
  - Done in the launch file
** =ROS_INFO=
- =ROS_INFO("Hello");=
- Prints out whatever is inside
- Cannot print out multiple things
** =ROS_INFO_STREAM=
- =ROS_INFO_STREAM("x = " << point.x << " y = " << point.y);=
- You can pipe information just like with cout
* PCL
- The Point Cloud Library
- Standard across most ROS projects
- Lots of useful data structures and algorithms focused on points

* What is a point cloud?
- A collection of points
  - Typically XYZ

* Write a node
- Now we want to have hal set himself facing an object
